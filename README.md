# clock_checker

Clock Checker is an application which allows you to check time and compare your system time with time from one of the most popular NTP servers in the world or with one you want to check.

# Requrements
Android 4.1.x or later

## Getting Started

There are ~~three~~ two ways of getting the app on your device:

### Get a release

Go [there](https://github.com/suprovsky/clock-checker/releases), find the lastes version of the app and download it. You will need to **enable** Unknown sources in your OS, it is usually in the Settings > Security.

### Compile app by yourself

It is very simple, just download `master` branch to your computer, open an IDE/Text Editor you want to use (in my case it is Visual Studio Code). You will need to have Flutter and Android SDK installed on your PC, so make sure you have it before opening the project. [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLSG_Wh_YWc) is a good video describing how to install all components needed in order to build that app.  
When compiling, make sure you use Release build profile, so you will have the best app experience possible.
